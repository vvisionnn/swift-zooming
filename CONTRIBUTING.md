## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 6.1+
- iOS 16.0+ target
- SwiftLint (for code formatting)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swiftui-zooming.git
   cd swiftui-zooming
   ```

2. **Install SwiftLint**:
   ```bash
   brew install swiftlint
   ```

3. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open Package.swift
   ```

4. **Build and test**:
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift test
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) and use SwiftLint for consistency.

### Key Principles

- **Clarity over brevity**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Performance**: Prioritize efficient implementations
- **SwiftUI conventions**: Follow SwiftUI patterns and naming
- **Type safety**: Leverage Swift's type system
- **No force unwrapping**: Use safe unwrapping patterns

### Code Organization

- **One class/struct per file** (unless closely related)
- **Group related functionality** using extensions
- **Use MARK comments** for organization
- **Keep functions focused** and single-purpose

### Documentation

- **Public APIs** must be documented
- **Use Swift doc comments** (`///`) for public members
- **Include examples** in documentation when helpful
- **Update README** for user-facing changes

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- **Unit tests** for all public APIs
- **Integration tests** for complex interactions
- **Performance tests** for critical paths
- **Edge case coverage** for boundary conditions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run tests with coverage
swift test --enable-code-coverage

# Run specific test
swift test --filter testName
```

### Test Guidelines

- **Descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Use meaningful assertions**
- **Mock external dependencies**

## Performance Guidelines

- **Profile before optimizing**
- **Measure performance impact** of changes
- **Avoid premature optimization**
- **Consider memory usage** alongside speed
- **Test on various devices** and iOS versions

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Stable, release-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/description`: Feature development
- `fix/description`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/description`: Critical fixes for main

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(zoom): add double-tap to zoom functionality
fix(container): resolve memory leak in hosting controller
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Release Process

1. **Version bump** in appropriate files
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with new features and fixes
3. **Create release PR** to main
4. **Tag release** after merge
5. **Update documentation** if needed

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and general discussion
- **Code Review**: Request feedback on your pull requests

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
